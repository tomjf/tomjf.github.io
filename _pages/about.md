I am a Research Associate in Machine Learning at Imperial College London, working with Dr Chen Qin in the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/) and [I-X](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/). My current research focuses on motion-robust and efficient fMRI using new techniques such as Gaussian Splatting.

Previously, I was a Research Associate in AI-enabled cardiac MRI at Kingâ€™s College London in the [Cardiac MRI group](https://x.com/KCL_CardiacMR) in the [School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis). My research there focused on inverse problems and [motion correction in MRI reconstruction of highly-undersampled cardiac MRI data](https://www.journalofcmr.com/article/S1097-6647(24)00797-X/fulltext). 

My undergraduate (Imperial College London), master's (University College London), and doctoral backgrounds have been in Physics. I was awarded my PhD in Astrophysics from University College London in 2020. For my PhD, I researched the [contribution of galaxies towards cosmic reionisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01741), and the [amount of molecular hydrogen in the local Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04959) using imaging, statistics and large ground- and space-based telescopes. I also worked as a Research Scientist in the Temperature and Humidity Group at the National Physical Laboratory where I worked on thermal imaging projects for ESA and a clinical trial for a thermal imaging device.
