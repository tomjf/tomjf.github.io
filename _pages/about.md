I am a Research Associate in Machine Learning at Imperial College London in the [EEE Department](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/) and [I-X](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/). My current research focuses on motion-robust and efficient fMRI using new techniques such as Gaussian Splatting.
